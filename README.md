## Interpola
Emission Interpolation to a new mesh
Based on the wrfinput an emissions inventory file is generated by using emission from other domain.

input files:
            wrfchemin.nc  !  Emission file to be interpolated
            wrfinput           ! Domain to be with the domain where the emissions will be interpolated


wrfchem  file contain emissions starting with "E_"
